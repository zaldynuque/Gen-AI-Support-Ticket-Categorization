# Gen-AI-Support-Ticket-Categorization
### Business Context
In today's dynamic business landscape, customer feedback is a critical factor in shaping the success of products and services. Responding swiftly and effectively to customer input enhances experiences, drives growth, and builds long-term customer relationships. As a Product Manager or Analyst, being attuned to your customers' voices is not just a best practice—it’s a strategic imperative.

Your organization may be overwhelmed with customer feedback and support tickets, but your role extends beyond processing these inputs. To manage customer experience and expectations effectively, you need a structured approach to identify the most pressing issues, set priorities, and allocate resources wisely.

One of the most effective strategies is to use large language models and Generative AI to automate support ticket categorization.

### Objective
Develop a Generative AI application using a Large Language Model to automate the classification and processing of support tickets. This application will predict ticket categories, assign priorities, suggest estimated resolution times, generate responses based on sentiment analysis, and store results in a structured DataFrame.
